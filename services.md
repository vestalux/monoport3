### Business Consulting
Contrary to popular belief not just blue-chip companies need consultants. Even small business can afford a good consultant. I specialize in providing marketing, manufacturing and automation advice to small and medium enterprises.

### Online presence management
Seems like small business owners nowadays have to be a PR manager, photographer, accountant and artisan all in one. I create engaging content specific to businesses and monitor social media reach across multiple platforms so the owners can focus on what they are really good at.


### Digital manufacturing
The digital revolution has started in every industry and to be competitive one has to keep up with the changing environment. Monoport provides embroidery digitizing, 3D printing and modeling services. These services help shorten lead times and cut back significantly time to market times.
