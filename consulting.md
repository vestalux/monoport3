### Business Consulting
Contrary to popular belief not just blue-chip companies need consultants. Even small business can afford a good consultant. I specialize in providing marketing, manufacturing and automation advice to small and medium enterprises. These companies support more than others to be able to break the barriers that prevent them from becoming more productive and competitive on the market. The solutions can be as simple as setting up an E-mail auto responder or as complex as implementing an ERP system and an automate manufacturing.

### Online presence management
Seems like small business owners nowadays have to be a PR manager, photographer, accountant and artisan all in one. I create engaging content specific to businesses and monitor social media reach across multiple platforms so the owners can focus on what they are really good at.
