## 

In my professional life I've been known to wear many hats, however some didn't really fit me. I've  worked on social networking sites' QA before they were cool. I've learned some front end development and graphic design, enough to supply local hardcore bands with a steady stream of custom websites and fliers. Then I moved onto bigger things and climbed the corporate ladder to the Pan-European Sales Strategy Planner position of a well known electronics manufacturer.

**Monoport** is a business I founded to make use of the experience gained in various disciplines. The business currently is a one man show, hence the name, however I utilise the vast network of professionals I've got to know over the years and use their knowledge or outsource tasks if necessary.
